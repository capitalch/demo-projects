      <p>Hello {{data.firstName}},</p>
      <p>My institute is excited to start using the questionnaire. It will help us gather information about you. Please take some time to complete the questionnaire anytime before your next appointment
        on {{data.appDate}}. </p>
      <p><b>How it works</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li> You can complete the questionnaire securely online. Your answers are confidential and will only be shared with
        us. </li>
        <li>You can move at your own pace, and you can stop and save your answers at any time. Return and finish it when
          you are ready.
        </li>
        <li> You can skip questions that you don’t wish to answer. The more questions you answer, the more likely I’ll be
          able to understand your capability as a student. </li>
        <li> At the end you can make a list of what you’d like to talk about during our appointment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>How it will help</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>All of the information will be sent to me so I can review it before our next appointment. </li>
        <li> It will allow us to guide you through the process of admission at our reputed institute. </li>
        <li> It will make it easier for us to track changes over time. </li>
      </ul>
